			Dogecoin Analysis Using Prophet Model <br />
			I collected data from Yahoo! Finance for the cryptocurrency called Dogecoin and
			ran some analysis on it in order to see if I can forecast the price of it. I utilized various
			software and tools to get the results which I needed. Some of these tools are Google
			Colab, Anaconda Software, Jupyter Notebook, R-Studio, and the microsoft office suite
			such as MS Excel and MS Word. I also used programming languages such as Python and
			R in order to further my analysis with the data that I collected from Yahoo! Finance. <br /> <br />
										
			The Prophet method that I used tests the general direction of Dogecoin based on
			the data being trained for one month, one year, and maximum duration of the data
			available on Yahoo! market. This does not, yet forecast the price of the Dogecoin within
			minutes; however, it does show the general direction of the stock, which is more crucial
			as of what is floating on the news and on the social media of famous influencers such as
			Elon Musk. <br /> <br />
										
			The reason that I used Prophet is that cryptocurrencies are simply too
			unpredictable unless there is an extended period of time with detailed historical
			observations provided. Dogecoin has had multiple strong seasonalities which has
			happened for the past decade, which is beyond the time-frame of Elon Muskâ€™s tweets.
			These events are previously known important, yet irregular, events.
